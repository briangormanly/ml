% This is to provide a LaTeX-based template for a letter that follows Marist's
% official publishing guidlines.
%
% Letter.tex
% This file is the one that you will edit more often. This is where you will
% specify your recipient and the main body of your letter. If you have not
% done so, you should have your information filled-in in MaristLetterDefs.tex
% in the first few lines.


\documentclass{article}

% Recipient info goes here
\providecommand\Maristtoname{Dr. Someone}
\providecommand\Maristtoaddress{Department of Something}

% Date (defaults to today)
\providecommand\Maristdate{\today}
% Subject line, if any
\providecommand\Maristsubject{\textbf{RE: Subject}}
% Opening and closing, (I was taught to use commas but you can remove them here)
\providecommand\Maristopening{Dear \Maristtoname,}
\providecommand\Maristclosing{Sincerely,}
\providecommand\Maristenclosure{Enclosure: a picture of a cute baby red fox}
